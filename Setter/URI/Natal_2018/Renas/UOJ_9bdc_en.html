			<div class="description">
				<p>An disease has attacked the reindeers and made them unable to fly to deliver Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>The reindeer elves have managed to identify a rather curious fact about this disease, which is contagious only if two or more diseased reindeer are in the same stable.</p>

<p>Each reindeer is in a room that is connected to another room by a corridor with <span class="math-tex">\(W\)&nbsp;meters, where these connected rooms form a stable. The solution, proposed by the elves experts, was that old Santa removed some corridors for the disease to be controlled. To remove a corridor of <span class="math-tex">\(W\) meters is necessary <span class="math-tex">\(W\) hours and as it is very close to Christmas, Santa asked for his help to minimize the time.</p>

<p>Help Santa determine the minimum time as possible so the disease does not</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><em>Santa's Tip: Initially there is only one stable, meaning all rooms are connected and there is no circular path.</em></p>

			<h2>Input</h2>

			<div class="input">
				<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="math-tex"><strong>N</strong>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5})\) the number of reindeers and <span class="math-tex"><strong>M</strong>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((0 \leq M \leq N)\)&nbsp;the number of reindeer that were diagnosed with the disease. Then follow <span class="math-tex">\(M
\) integers, where the whole <span class="math-tex">\(M_{i}\) is the index of the sick reindeer's room. Then follow <span class="math-tex">\(N-1
\) lines each with three integers <span class="math-tex"><strong>U, V, W</strong>, where <span class="math-tex">\((U \neq V)\)&nbsp;e <span class="math-tex">\( (0 \leq U, V &lt; N)\) and <span class="math-tex">\((1 \leq W \leq 1 \times 10^{6})\) there is a <span class="math-tex">\(W\)-sized corridor that connects rooms <span class="math-tex">\(U\) and <span class="math-tex">\(V\) (<em>the corridor can be used in either direction</em>).</p>
